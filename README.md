  SanoHealth is a health and wellness app that utilizes features such as location-based contact-tracing, SMS alerts, wellness evaluations, and health activities in order to help users keep track of their health, fitness, and consumption during these times of mandatory lockdown.
  The SanoHealth app was created by Christiana Marchese and Rachel Homan for the A2CN Hack-In-Place Hackathon, and it was inspired by a previous contact-tracing app created by Christiana, Rachel, and their friend Saatvik Kher: HenHealth.
  The intention of this app is to make it easy for people to focus on health and wellness during these times of uncertainty and shelter-in-place orders. we hope that are app enables and empowers users to take back control over their life and everyday habits.
